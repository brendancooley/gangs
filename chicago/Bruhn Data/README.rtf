\f0\fs24 \cf0 This zip file contains two folders. The folder titled ``raw_maps\'92\'92 contains the original, unedited gang maps provided to me by CPD. They cover the years 2004-2012, and 2014-2017. The officer who provided me the maps told me that there was no update in 2013. The maps themselves are shape files which you should be able to read into any standard GIS software. The folder titled ``clean_maps\'92\'92 contains my cleaned version of the maps. The cleaned maps are contained in an R ``simple features\'92\'92 data frame and can be read into R using the ``sf\'92\'92 package. Finally, I also include a file titled ``clean_gang_maps_replication.\'92\'92 This is my code that maps the raw gang maps into the clean gang maps. If you try to run it, you will likely need to change the file paths. \
