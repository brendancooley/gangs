## Retailers - Street Gangs

> "Mexican DTOs and criminal groups are the principal transporters of illicit drugs into and through the Chicago HIDTA region" - DEA

> "Street gangs control most retail drug distribution in the [Chicago] and are increasingly exploiting relationships with other gangs or DTOs and use of technology to advance their criminal activities" - DEA

- Some involvement in production (e.g. converting powder to crack cocaine, repackaging)
- Non-economic operating expenses dominate...

## Territoriality

> "If you want to expand your sales, you have to expand your street corners. You know, you have to physically take street corners, which is a violent act." - John Lippert, *Bloomberg Markets*

> "Because crack distribution generates significant profits for street gangs, low-level rival gang members routinely engage in violence to acquire turf or steal drugs or drug proceeds" - DEA

## Price and Violent Competition

**Gang Wars**

- @Levitt2000
	+ Gang wars occur about 25 percent of the time
	+ Gang wars result in 20-30 percent drop in prices and quantities sold
	+ Death rate (annual) for members: 7 percent
- @Papachristos2009
	+ 35 percent of homicides in 1994, 1998, 2002 documented as gang-related by homicide detectives
	+ 88 percent inter-gang

> "In 2006 nearly 50 percent of the homicides and a large percentage of other violent crimes and property crimes committed in Chicago were attributed to street gangs that are involved in drug trafficking" - DEA

**Law Enforcement and Imprisonment**

> "3,500 of the 13,000 inmates currently housed in the Cook County Jail have some gang affiliation" - DEA

- At any given time, 1/3 of gang leadership is imprisoned [@Levitt2000]

## Questions

**Labor Market for Retailers**

- If retail prices are so high, why are earnings for dealers so low?
- Why is compensation so low, given risk?

**Territoriality and Competition**

- Why is violence so uniquely associated with black markets?
- Violence versus prices as competitive means...complements or substitutes?
- Consumers presumably can travel quickly to different territories...what benefits does 'turf' bring if not market power?

**Policy**

- How would increased police enforcement (seizures or arrests) affect competition (price and violent) between groups?
- Radical counterfactual: drug legalization
	+ Tradeoff(?): violence versus consumption
