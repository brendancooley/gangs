Conflict within and between street gangs is responsible for much of the interpersonal violence within the United States, but gangs' clandestine nature makes them difficult to study systematically. In this paper, we have developed and validated a method for detecting the presence and territorial extent of these organizations using widely available data. We demonstrated the method's ability to detect and map the territory of the largest gangs operating in Chicago. While the method performs relatively well at this task, it is not able to capture the richness and density of Chicago's gang network, which contains many more organizations than we are able to detect. Moreover, the method necessarily collapses the dynamic process of border conflict and adjustment into a static representation gang territory. The wars we use to detect the presence of gangs and their borders almost certainly move those borders around. While running the estimator on discrete time periods could produce a panel of partition, this would come at the cost of statistical precision. Perhaps this shortcoming could be addressed in part by developing explicitly dynamic models that take into account this process of border change over time. 

Recognizing these measurement limitations, we view this paper as the first step toward studying gang structure cross sectionally. Almost all large municipalities record and report the data necessary to estimate our model, meaning our method can be easily extended to other locales. We are in the process of collecting these data and will report and make public model output when it becomes available. Once estimates of the number of gangs and their territorial partitions have been produced, researchers can study the industrial organization of street gangs cross sectionally. Our uncertainty intervals will allow such studies to explicitly account for measurement error in the input data. We hope that this will facilitate the study of the relationship between gangs, violence, policing, and poverty in America.
